        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>The mission of the Cultural Fair is:
          <br>To increase awareness and understanding of, and pride in, the cultural and ethnic diversity of the community and its international ties
          <br>To create an atmosphere of neighborly celebration
          <br>To make the community aware of the international connections of its individuals, businesses and organizations
          <br>To help bring ethnic minorities into the community mainstream
          <br>
          <br>The Cultural Fair started in 2004 and has been held annually since then. Each year over 1,600 people attend the Fair. A village celebration is created with people of all ages and many cultures participating in sharing stories, music, performances, and food.</p>

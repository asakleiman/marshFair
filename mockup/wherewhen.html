<h1>Tips for Having A Great Time at the Fair</h1>
      <p>Pick a great Fair attitude.  The Fair is a unique opportunity to explore and learn about the cultures, the family histories and the civic activities that all come together to make our community so wonderful. Take your time as you go through the Fair, talk with everyone, explore everything. The Fair is about sharing and learning. No question is a dumb one. Decide to approach people and things that are different from you and learn about them. The Fair embraces the richness of diversity in our community and we ask you to do so as well with respect for each other, and joy in having a time to do this. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing as you will be exploring and maybe dancing a bit to the entertainment.  <br><br>Bring money as our exhibitors will be selling all sorts of amazing items from their cultures, home countries and civic activities.
        <br><br>Bring an appetite. Our food court will have a great selection of foods for sale. Consider making lunch at the Fair your main meal of the day.<br><br>Take photos and share them with family, friends and with us on Facebook.<br><br><br></p>

in the Related Events tab, please delete the recycling the world info. That will leave the section empty for now and  I’ll have some content to add later. thanks
For the Educate At the Fair section of the Participate tab, there is a sentence,  What to present.
Please add under that as part of that paragraph, the following:

Present your stories about your travels, cultural traditions in your family or cultures you learned about  in your travels. Tell us about foods and clothing and dance and any other aspects of your cultural heritage or of cultures which you experienced in your travels. Use videos, photos and bring items to share as a ‘show and tell.’  We may ask you if it ok to record your talk so that we can share it with others through our website

Be a S.T.A.R.

Be a STAR at the Cultural Fair!
As a food vendor for the 2020 Cultural Fair, fairgoers will be encouraged to try items from each vendor.  As they do so, they will judge the item for flavor, aroma, and appearance and record that on their food judge ballots. We will collect the ballots and the food vendor with the highest reviews is the STAR of the Fair.
Grand Prize: Your food vendor fee is waived and you will receive a certificate you can proudly display. You will also be included in our website and Facebook as the Samples Tasting And Review (STAR) of the 2020 Fair.

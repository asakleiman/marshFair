                of diversity in our community and we ask you to do so as well with respect for each other, and joy in having a time to do this. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing as you will be exploring and maybe dancing a bit to the entertainment.

            <h2>Provide Food at the Fair</h2>
            <p>The Food Court is the hub of the Fair where folks gather to sample and share food together. A shared meal is a core part of community in many cultures and we experience that community at the Fair’s Food Court. The more diversity of foods the
                better! Food vendors can be professionals with restaurants and catering services and “home grown” with their specialties. Foods include appetizers, main dishes, desserts, beverages and other items. Check out the Food Court Photo Gallery
                <a href="gallery.html">here.</a>.</p>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>“Sharing what we love to make and seeing and talking to so many people.”</li>
                <li>“Friendly environment as always. Love the crew for setup and take down.”</li>
                <li>“The diversity of the food vendors and how people were open to trying different types of foods.”</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Food Vendor Perspective</h3>
            <p>Fairgoers enjoy talking with you about the foods you prepared and their connection to your culture. Be ready to serve your delicacies and talk about them. Respect and curiosity are key values to bring and support. The food court is a little
                community and what you bring, both with your foods and your presence, help create that sense of community.</p>

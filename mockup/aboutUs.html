        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>We are you, members of the Marshfield Community. And like you, we have a variety of family histories, cultures and roles. The Marshfield Cultural Fair is a project of the Marshfield Cultural Fair Association (MCFA) of Marshfield Wisconsin and its partners: the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point At Marshfield Office of Continuing Education, Marshfield Social Justice and The Chestnut Avenue Center for the Arts. MCFA is a non-profit organization run by volunteers under the umbrella of the Marshfield Area Chamber Foundation.<br><br>The Fair originated as positive response to a holocaust denier’s public displays and statements in our community in the early part of this century. Rather than respond with anger, a group formed with the intention to respond with education, inclusion and support for all. This group became the Marshfield Social Justice Association. That group’s activities led to the decision to host an annual fair that celebrates all cultures and ethnic groups. The Fair became a big success and led to development of the Marshfield Cultural Fair Association in 2004 to specifically run the Fair.<br><br>Since 2004 the Marshfield Cultural Fair Association has sponsored an annual fair at the UW-Marshfield/Wood County. The Association is completely volunteer run. No one receives compensation for service on the MCFA or work at the Fair. Each member donates time and talents out of commitment to the Fair’s mission statement. Members give many hours each year to develop and run the Fair, which is the biggest one-day non-sports event in Marshfield.<br><br></p>

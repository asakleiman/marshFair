No, more as a resource for teachers and others trying to learn more about cultural diversity and the issues that affect our understanding.  We'd like a page with relevant educational links, perhaps a page with links to other cultural festivals, and some content that is yet to be determined.  Mike is the one pushing for this, but we all support the idea.  He has more specifics.

Space for more material.  We would like to make this a year-round resource for educators and community groups.

More interactive.

Clearer route to the scheduling which is what most users want.

        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>The mission of the Cultural Fair is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>To increase awareness and understanding of, and pride in, the cultural and ethnic diversity of the community and its international ties</p></li>
            <li><p>To create an atmosphere of neighborly celebration</p></li>
            <li><p>To make the community aware of the international connections of its individuals, businesses and organizations</p></li>
            <li><p>To help bring ethnic minorities into the community mainstream</p></li>
          <br>
        </ul>
            <p><br>The Cultural Fair started in 2004 and has been held annually since then. Each year over 1,600 people attend the Fair. A village celebration is created with people of all ages and many cultures participating in sharing stories, music, performances, and food.            
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h1>History:</h1>
      <p>The Fair originated as positive response to a holocaust denier’s public displays and statements in our community in the early part of this century. Rather than respond with anger, a group formed with the intention to respond with education, inclusion and support for all. This group became the Marshfield Social Justice Association. That group’s activities led to the decision to host an annual fair that celebrates all cultures and ethnic groups. The Fair became a big success and led to development of the Marshfield Cultural Fair Association in 2004 to specifically run the Fair.<br><br>

        Since 2004 the Marshfield Cultural Fair Association has sponsored an annual fair at the UW-Marshfield/Wood County. The Association is completely volunteer run. No one receives compensation for service on the MCFA or work at the Fair. Each member donates time and talents out of commitment to the Fair’s mission statement. Members give many hours each year to develop and run the Fair, which is the biggest one-day non-sports event in Marshfield. </p>

          <h1>Resources</h1>

          Consistent with our Mission to increase awareness and understanding of and pride in the cultural diversity of our communities, we have included links to organizations, events and other resources. These are offered to help expand our awareness of each other, our strengths and our challenges.

          Included below are resources we have found so far in our explorations. Any omissions of groups are unintentional. We welcome suggestions on resources you know. Please share! Thanks.
      </div>

        <h1>Historical Resources</h1>
        <h2>The Wisconsin Historical Society.</h2>
        <p>The Society’s Mission, Vision and Values are:
          Mission: The Wisconsin Historical Society connects people to the past by collecting, preserving, and sharing stories. Vision: Enriching and transforming lives through unparalleled access to history. Values: We believe that increasing the public's knowledge of history has profound societal, cultural, and economic benefit.  https://www.wisconsinhistory.org </p>
        <h2>Wisconsin Biographies:</h2>
<p>Wisconsin Biographies is a collection of media to enrich the social studies and literacy curriculum, using the stories of notable figures in Wisconsin history. For each story, a 3-5 minute animated video engages learners of all ages. The content was designed around 4th grade standards, but is appropriate for use with younger and older students.

        <h1>Ethnic, Racial  Perspective Resources</h1>
        <h2>What Is Race: PBS Series </h2>
        <p>Race is one topic where we all think we're experts. Yet ask 10 people to define race or name "the races," and you're likely to get 10 different answers. Few issues are characterized by more contradictory assumptions and myths, each voiced with absolute certainty. In producing this series, we felt it was important to go back to first principles and ask, What is this thing called "race?" - a question so basic it is rarely raised. What we discovered is that most of our common assumptions about race - for instance that the world's people can be divided biologically along racial lines - are wrong. Yet the consequences of racism are very real. www.pbs.org/race/001_WhatIsRace/001_00-home.htm</p>
        <h2>Check you Biases with the Implicit Bias Tests: </h2>
        <p>Project Implicit is a non-profit organization and international collaboration between researchers who are interested in implicit social cognition - thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness and control. The goal of the organization is to educate the public about hidden biases and to provide a “virtual laboratory” for collecting data on the Internet.
    https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/index.jsp </p>



        <h2>Love Has No Labels.  </h2>
<p>Love Has No Labels is a movement to promote acceptance and inclusion of all people across race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age and ability. We believe love is the most powerful force to overcome bias. We celebrate diversity and encourage people to come together because we know, together, we can create a more inclusive world.

        <h2>The Race Card Project:</h2>
        <p>I asked people to think about their experiences, questions, hopes, dreams, laments or observations about race and identity. Then, I asked that they take those thoughts and distill them to just one sentence that had only six words.
What would your 6 words be?

        <h1>Cultural Opportunities in Wisconsin and the Region</h1>
        <h2>Milwaukee	</h2><p>									Milwaukee is a city comprised of many diverse cultures, religions, and identities, which we celebrate and pay homage to in several ways. We have festivals, restaurants, galleries, dance troupes, and theaters that showcase every ethnic culture and faith that call the city home, plus a very LGBTQ friendly atmosphere. Additionally, the City of Milwaukee and VISIT Milwaukee welcome travelers of all abilities for both business.

        <h2>Green Bay:</h2>

We support the preservation and sharing of diverse cultures, as well as the full inclusion of all individuals at every level of our community.

        <h2>The Cultural Wellness Center: Minnesota</h2>
<p>Unleashing the power of citizens to heal themselves and build community.
The health of one’s cultural identity is directly related to one’s personal health, the health of one’s community and one’s cultural group. Culture and epistemology are integral to understanding human behavior. Reconciliation and bridging between cultures contribute to healing in the cultural dimension, which, in turn, affects community and personal health.
